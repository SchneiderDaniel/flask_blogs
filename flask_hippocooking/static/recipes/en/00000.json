If you have a classic wooden bear claw mold (available at any Christmas market, see the image above), place the balls on the baking tray, moisten the wooden mold, sprinkle sugar onto the mold, press the mold onto the ball, and then lift it off. Note: The first option has a bit less sugar, but only the second option gives the bear claw its well-known sugar crust."
